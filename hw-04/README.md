Reflection

In reflecting on this assignment, I understand that my main instinct is to have the mind of a developer. With the given requirements of the assignment, I only focused on the the delivery of the basic requirement of the statement to be recieved. In doing so, I made it slightly hard to fully test the function to all its compability. For instance, you would need to know the function's statement before hand in order to test if it was correct. In the future, it would be best to implement objects into the function so that tester could search for a specific repo and it would return the commit count. So, through this reflection, I understand that I need to focus more on how to test and what makes for a better testing experiance rather than the code basic requirements.
