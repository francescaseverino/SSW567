# Report: Homework 5

### Summary

This homework assignment was very helpful understanding the concepts learned in the previous lecture. I found it very useful when understanding which parts of my code I needed to be improved. My code coverage reached 100% on the initial run, using coverage.py. While my coverage report says a total of 35%, I think that my python files are messed up and it ultimately was casuing the coverage to go down for some reason. Nonetheless, I did recieve a 100% on my coverage of the two files being examined, and I did not need to fix or add any tests. Using Pylint, it helped to reorganize my logic and thought process. I saw how naming and even amount of white-spaces are detected and need to be fixed to a certain standard. Overall, it was a really helpful homework, and I will try to use these in future projects.

### Detailed Anaylsis

1. Github URL: https://github.com/francescaseverino/SSW567/blob/main/hw-02a/tri_angle.py
2. Static Code Analyzer: Pylint
3. Code Coverage: Coverage.py
4. Because my original test cases achieved over 80% code coverage, I did not need to add any additional test cases, according to Coverage.py. Nonetheless, the test cases can be found at https://github.com/francescaseverino/SSW567/blob/main/hw-02a/TestTriangle.py

5.4 Code coverage after any changes to the programs (coverage should be > 80%)

    N/A,  it was 100% on the first attempt.
