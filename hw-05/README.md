# Report: Homework 5

### Summary

This homework assignment was very helpful understanding the concepts learned in the previous lecture. I found it very useful when understanding which parts of my code I needed to be improved. My code coverage reached 100% on the initial run, using coverage.py. While my coverage report says a total of 35%, I think that my python files are messed up and it ultimately was casuing the coverage to go down for some reason. Nonetheless, I did recieve a 100% on my coverage of the two files being examined, and I did not need to fix or add any tests. Using Pylint, it helped to reorganize my logic and thought process. I saw how naming and even amount of white-spaces are detected and need to be fixed to a certain standard. Overall, it was a really helpful homework, and I will try to use these in future projects.

### Detailed Anaylsis

1. Github URL: https://github.com/francescaseverino/SSW567/blob/main/hw-02a/tri_angle.py
2. Static Code Analyzer: Pylint
3. Code Coverage: Coverage.py
4. Becuase my original test cases achieved over 80% code coverage, I did not need to add any additional test cases, according to Coverage.py. Nonetheless, the test cases can be found at https://github.com/francescaseverino/SSW567/blob/main/hw-02a/TestTriangle.py

5.1 Static code analysis report on original program

5.2 Code coverage report before any changes to the program

5.3 Static code analysis report after changes made to eliminate issues

5.4 Code coverage after any changes to the programs (coverage should be > 80%)

    N/A,  it was 100% on the first attempt.
